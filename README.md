<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-[Use Git to manage and track changes to your code.]
-[Use a terminal or command prompt]
-[An internet connection]
-[A code editor like Visual Studio Code]

### Create

-[GitHub repo]
-[New branch]

### Add
-[.gitignore]
-[node_modules].
-[Descriptive README file].

### Set up

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. You can use the cd command to change directories.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository: git clone. with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.

4. Press Enter and git will start downloading the files from the repository to your local machine.

5. Once the download is complete, navigate into the repository directory by running cd repository

6. You can now make changes to the files and use git commands to keep track of the changes.

7. To push the changes to the remote repository, you need to be logged in to your github account.

8. Run git add . to stage all changes

9. Run git commit -m "your commit message" to commit the changes to your local repository

10. Run git push origin master to push the changes to the remote repository.

### Install

Set up linters in your local env
Note: The npm package manager is going to create a node_modules directory to install all of your dependencies. You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it:

Webhint
A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors.

NOTE: If you are running on Windows, you need to initialize npm to create package.json file.

npm init -y
Run
npm install --save-dev hint@7.x
not sure how to use npm? Read this.
Copy .hintrc to the root directory of your project.
Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.
If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it.
Run
npx hint .
Fix validation errors.

Stylelint
A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

Run

npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
not sure how to use npm? Read this.

Copy .stylelintrc.json to the root directory of your project.

Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.

If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it.
Run npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" on the root of your directory of your project.

Fix linter errors.

IMPORTANT NOTE: feel free to research auto-correct options for Stylelint if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code

### Usage

you can open the project by launching the Live Server plugging in visual studio code
